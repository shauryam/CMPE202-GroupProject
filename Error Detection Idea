As this was the first week after the team creation, our team met to decide upon the project topic. 
All the team members had their own set of ideas just like I had.
My idea was to build a multiplayer error detection game which could teach people of bit level errors are detected in the computer.
This idea is being reviewed by the other members of the team.
